# react-template

### Requirements
1. VSCode
2. Nightly Javascript Debugger (VSC Extension)
3. Chrome & Chrome Debugger (VSC Extension)
4. Linux (killall & bash)
5. Yarn
6. No spaces in the directory path (module syntax has no \_\_dirname, and using url.imports encodes paths like urls, and path doesn't understand url paths)

### Start
1. run `yarn install` in both `client` and `server`
2. run `start debugging session` from VSC's Debug Dropdown
